\title{Calculate position effect ratios}
\usage{
calculate_position_effect(dataframe, annotation, timepoint, reference = "Day0")
}
\arguments{
\item{dataframe}{A data frame with COUNT, condition, NAME, SEQUENCE, and
targeton_id columns.}

\item{annotation}{A data frame with sequence annotations containing Seq
and Targeton_ID columns.}

\item{timepoint}{Character string specifying the numerator timepoint
(e.g., "Day4", "Day10").}

\item{reference}{Character string specifying the denominator condition
(default: "Day0").}
}
\value{
A data frame with mean counts per condition, ratio calculations,
and joined annotation data including Targeton_ID and vcf_pos.
}
\description{
Calculates the ratio of mean counts between a specified timepoint and a
reference condition for each sequence. Counts are averaged across
replicates within each condition before computing the ratio.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
pos_effect <- calculate_position_effect(
  dataframe = count_data,
  annotation = annotation_df,
  timepoint = "Day4"
)

# Using Day4 as reference instead of plasmid
pos_effect <- calculate_position_effect(
  dataframe = count_data,
  annotation = annotation_df,
  timepoint = "Day10",
  reference = "Day4"
)
}
