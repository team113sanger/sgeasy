\title{Calculate position effect ratios}
\usage{
calculate_position_effect(dataframe, annotation, timepoint)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataframe}{A data frame with COUNT, condition, NAME, and SEQUENCE columns.}

\item{annotation}{A data frame with sequence annotations containing a Seq column.}

\item{timepoint}{Character string specifying the timepoint to compare against Day0
(e.g., "Day10", "Day14").}
}
\value{
A data frame with mean counts per condition, ratio calculations,
and joined annotation data.
}
\description{
Calculates the ratio of counts between a specified timepoint and Day0
for each sequence, grouped by NAME and condition.

\examples{
\dontrun{
pos_effect <- calculate_position_effect(
  dataframe = count_data,
  annotation = annotation_df,
  timepoint = "Day10"
)
