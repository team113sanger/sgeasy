\title{Extend a loess fit to cover edge positions}
\usage{
extend_loess_fit(fit_vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit_vector}{A numeric vector of fitted values, possibly with NAs at
the edges.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length with edge NAs filled.
}
\description{
Fills NA values at the start and end of a fitted vector with the nearest
non-NA value. Interior NAs are left unchanged. This handles cases where
the loess prediction cannot extrapolate beyond the range of the training
data.
