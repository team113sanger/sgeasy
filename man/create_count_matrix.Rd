\title{Create count matrix from annotated data}
\usage{
create_count_matrix(data, sample_pattern = "count")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with SEQUENCE column and sample count columns.}

\item{sample_pattern}{Pattern to identify sample columns
(default: "count").}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with sequences as row names and samples as columns.
}
\description{
Extracts sequence identifiers and sample counts into a numeric matrix
suitable for differential analysis.
}
\details{
The sample_pattern is used with \code{starts_with()} to select count columns.
When using pivot_wider with \code{names_prefix = "count_"}, columns will be
named like "count_SAMPLE_A_10_pel0000", and "count" will match these.

\examples{
\dontrun{
count_matrix <- create_count_matrix(annotated_data)
