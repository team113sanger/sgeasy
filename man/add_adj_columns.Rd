\title{Add adjusted statistics for a single contrast}
\usage{
add_adj_columns(data, suffix)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with log2FoldChange, lfcSE, and median columns.}

\item{suffix}{The contrast suffix (e.g., "condition_Day7_vs_Day4").}
}
\value{
Data frame with additional adj_lfc_\emph{, adj_score_}, pval_\emph{, and
FDR_} columns for the specified suffix.
}
\description{
Computes adjusted log fold change, z-score, p-value and FDR for a
specified contrast suffix.
}
\details{
The adjusted log fold change subtracts the median LFC (from neutral variants)
to center the distribution. The adjusted score is then computed as
adj_lfc / lfcSE, which follows approximately a standard normal distribution
under the null hypothesis. P-values are computed from a two-sided normal test.
